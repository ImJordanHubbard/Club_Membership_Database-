This project is a SQL-based Club Membership Database developed to apply and reinforce my understanding of SQL and database management fundamentals. The database includes tables for managing members, membership types, events, and attendance records. It supports basic operations like adding, updating, and deleting records, as well as more complex queries involving joins, aggregations, and subqueries. The project also includes views and stored procedures to streamline data access and manipulation.
